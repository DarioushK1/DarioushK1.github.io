=== Homework assignments
- There will be *approximately 10* homework assignments. 
- You will be given *5* free late days which you may use as you please throughout the semester, 
after which no late assignments will be accepted. 
- You are allowed to work on homework in small groups, 
but you must write up your own homework solutions and code to hand in. 
- Each homework problem will be graded on a scale of 0-100. 
- Assignment with the lowest grade for each student will be dropped. 
- You are encouraged to use [./hw-template/ME340-template.zip this] LaTeX template to write your solutions.
- Each homework handed in with the aformentioned LaTeX format can earn extra credit up to 10 points on the scale of 0-100.
=== Lab assignments
The labs are managed by [d-block@illinois.edu Dr. Daniel Block] and Lab TAs. 
The information on lab sessions (lab handouts and other details) are found [http://coecsl.ece.illinois.edu/me340/ here].
- Lab attendance is compulsory and a passing grade for each of the seven laboratories is expected in this course.
- You must complete the pre-lab assignment and become familiar with that week’s lab handout material before arriving to lab.
- For all lab-related questions should be addressed to the lab TA assigned to your lab section.
Make use of the lab office hours.
=== Exams
There will be *one in-class midterm* exam and a *2-hour final* exam. Format/Dates TBD.

=== Extra Credit
You can earn an extra credit up to 10\%.
=== Grading
- *Homework assignments: 45\%*
- *Lab assignments: 15\%*
- *Midterm Exam: 15\%*
- *Final Exam: 25\%*
- *Extra Credit: 4.5\% on Homeworks, 5\% on Exams*
